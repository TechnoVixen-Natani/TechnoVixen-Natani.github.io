      <description>Ryder Bio Ryder is a rescue cat. He was approximately 2 years old when we got him from the shelter. Original name was Pedro. His ear was cut when we got him. He knows how to sit and stand on hind legs for treats. Very attached to me.
Tootie Bio Tootie is also a rescue, we got her from my brother in law, we believe she was the runt of the litter.</description>

      <description>I grew up in a small town in Michigan, family of 5 and I was the middle child, the rainbow sheep of the family. Not that it mattered much because I grew up to be awesome!

The first year we studied CompTIA A+ and Network+.</description>
