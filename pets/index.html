<p>Ryder is a rescue cat. He was approximately 2 years old when we got him from the shelter. Original name was Pedro. His ear was cut when we got him.
He knows how to sit and stand on hind legs for treats. Very attached to me.</p>
<h2 id="tootie"><strong>Tootie</strong></h2>

    <img src="https://TechnoVixen-Natani.github.io/img/Tootie.jpg"  alt="Tootie kitty"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />


<h4 id="bio-1"><strong>Bio</strong></h4>
<p>Tootie is also a rescue, we got her from my brother in law, we believe she was the runt of the litter. She had a skin condition which is resolved now
but her hind end still hasn&rsquo;t grown fur back fully. We got her about a year before Ryder.</p>
<h2 id="jerry"><strong>Jerry</strong></h2>
<p>Not pictured unfortunately but he was my wife&rsquo;s leopard gecko. He died September 2022, we had him for 5 years.</p>
